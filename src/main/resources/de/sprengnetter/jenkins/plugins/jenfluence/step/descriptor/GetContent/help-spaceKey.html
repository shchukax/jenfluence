<div align="center">
    This is the key of the space where to search for content. Usually it is a short form of the title of the
    space. <br>
    If you have no clue where to find the key you can visit the space in your browser and extract the key from the URL.
    <br>
    <p>It will look like this: <br>
        <em>http://$host/display/<strong>KEY</strong>/.../...</em></p>
    <p>Copy that key and paste it in here.</p>
</div>
